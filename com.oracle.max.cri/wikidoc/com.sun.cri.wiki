A virtual machine compiler-runtime interface (CRI). 
Specifically, this package defines an interface between the compiler and the runtime system of a virtual machine for the instruction set defined in [{{Bytecodes}}|http://kenai.com/hg/maxine~maxine/file/tip/com.oracle.max.cri/src/com/sun/cri/bytecode/Bytecodes.java]. The interface has three components:  
# the {{compiler-provided interface}} that must be used by the runtime. 
# the {{runtime-provided interface}} that must be used by the compiler. 
# the {{XIR interface}} for translating object operations. 

 The interface is independent of any particular compiler or runtime implementation. 


For more details see [Improving Compiler-Runtime Separation with XIR|http://labs.oracle.com/projects/maxine/publications/vee2010.pdf].
