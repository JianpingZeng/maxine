JDK implementation support.  We substitute certain methods in the JDK with our own implementation in Java, without touching any JDK source code. For each class, in which this occurs, we create a parallel class, in a parallel package structure underneath here. We name the substitute class like the original class, for easy recognition, but with with "_" appended for better distinction. We annotate the substitute class with '@METHOD_ANNOTATIONS', passing the original class as annotation parameter. Then we annotate the methods in our substitute class, which substitute original methods with the '@SUBSTITUTE' annotation.
